name: orx-paper
description: "Draft an academic paper or preprint as LaTeX. Create a .tex file in the project working tree, where it renders for the user and compiles to PDF. Use for a paper, preprint, manuscript, arXiv or submission draft, or a section of one; generic reports and result summaries belong to `orx-reports`."
---

Write the paper as a real `.tex` file in the working tree. Do not answer a paper
request with an outline in chat, and keep the `.tex` out of the artifacts
directory: a `.tex` is compiled where it sits in the live checkout, and the PDF
is written beside it.

## Create the file on the first request

Create `paper.tex` at the repo root (`<topic>.tex` when several papers coexist),
write real content into it, then link it in chat using the session playbook's
evidence-and-links contract so the user can open the rendered document. An
outline in chat gives them nothing to render.

To add a reusable template to OpenResearch, load `orx-customize`.

## Check for a template before writing a preamble

The user may have uploaded their own LaTeX template — a conference class, a lab
preprint style. Look before you write anything:

```sh
ls .orx/latex-templates/
```

- **Exactly one template** — use it. Do not ask; it is there to be used.
- **Several** — name them and ask which, unless the request already said.
- **None** — use the preamble below.

To use one, copy its class and style files next to your `.tex` so the compiler
finds them, and start from its entry `.tex` rather than the default preamble:

```sh
cp .orx/latex-templates/<name>/*.cls .orx/latex-templates/<name>/*.sty \
   .orx/latex-templates/<name>/*.bst .
cp .orx/latex-templates/<name>/<entry>.tex paper.tex
```

Then fill in the template's own structure — keep its `\documentclass` line, its
package list, and its section skeleton, and replace only the placeholder
content. A conference class encodes margins, fonts, and an anonymization mode
that the submission is checked against; overriding it defeats the point of
uploading it. If the template needs a package the machine lacks, say so rather
than quietly switching to the default preamble.

## A preamble that compiles

When there is no template, start from this. It covers everything the sections
below use:

```latex
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amsthm}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{booktabs}
\usepackage{listings}
\usepackage{natbib}
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\newtheorem{lemma}[theorem]{Lemma}

\title{...}
\author{...}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
...
\end{document}
```

**Every environment needs the package that defines it.** This is the most common
way a draft fails to compile, and the failure is fatal, not cosmetic:

| Using | Requires |
| --- | --- |
| `theorem`, `lemma`, `proof` | `amsthm` **and** a `\newtheorem` for each |
| `lstlisting` | `listings` |
| `align`, `equation*`, `\text` | `amsmath` |
| `\toprule`, `\midrule` | `booktabs` |
| `\includegraphics` | `graphicx` |
| `\url`, `\href` | `hyperref` |
| `\citet`, `\citep` | `natbib` (plain `\cite` needs nothing) |

Load only packages you use, and never invent a macro without defining it.

## Say so when the document needs a different engine

Papers compile with pdfLaTeX by default. A document that needs XeLaTeX or
LuaLaTeX — `fontspec`, `unicode-math`, a system OpenType font — must say so on
its first line, or it will be built with the wrong engine and fail:

```latex
% !TeX program = lualatex
```

Do not add the line otherwise: pdfLaTeX is the most widely supported engine, and
`microtype`'s letter tracking works only there.

## Structure

`\begin{abstract}`, then `\section`/`\subsection`. Number equations you refer
to (`\begin{equation}\label{eq:loss}`) and cite them with `\eqref{eq:loss}`;
use the starred form for equations you never reference. Label every float and
refer to it as `Table~\ref{tab:main}`, never as "the table below" — a float
moves.

## Figures and tables

Read the `orx-figures` module before making a figure. A default matplotlib plot
dropped into a paper is a defect a reviewer will name: wrong physical size,
titled where the caption belongs, and rasterized where the document wants
vector. That module also covers method diagrams in TikZ, which compile in this
tree exactly like the paper does.

Reference image files that actually exist in the tree, by path relative to the
`.tex`:

```latex
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/loss_curve.pdf}
```

Write the extension out, and confirm the file exists before referencing it — a
missing graphic fails the build.

## Bibliography

Use an inline `thebibliography` block:

```latex
\begin{thebibliography}{9}
\bibitem[Kaplan et al.(2020)]{kaplan2020} Kaplan et al. Scaling laws for
  neural language models. 2020.
\end{thebibliography}
```

It compiles in one pass. A `\bibliography{refs}` with a separate `.bib` needs a
biber round trip and shows as an unresolved reference until then.

The `[Author(Year)]` label is what `\citet` prints; without it natbib has no name
to use. Give every entry one — for a paper whose authors you do not know, use a
short title rather than inventing names.

Pick the citation command by how the sentence reads:

- `\citet{kaplan2020}` — the citation is the subject: *Kaplan et al. (2020) show…*
- `\citep{kaplan2020}` — a parenthetical aside: *…is predictable (Kaplan et al., 2020)*
- Plain `\cite` under natbib behaves like `\citet`, so `GRPO~\cite{x}` comes out as
  *GRPO Shao et al. (2024)*, with no parentheses. Write `\citep` for an aside.

Find real references with the `orx-lit-review` workflow: retrieve candidates
with `orx discover`, then read selected sources with `orx paper`. A fabricated
citation is worse than no citation.

## Results come from runs, not from memory

Every number in a results table must come from an actual run — read it with
`orx logs` (see the `orx-evidence` skill). Never write a placeholder metric that
reads as real. If a number is not measured yet, say so in the text.

## How the file gets compiled

A `.tex` in the working tree is compiled with whatever LaTeX engine the machine
has — tectonic, latexmk, or pdflatex — and the resulting `paper.pdf` is written
next to the source. Saving an edit recompiles it, so the PDF tracks the file.

There is no approximate preview to fall back on: a document that does not
compile has nothing to show. A failed build is therefore not a cosmetic problem
to note and move past — it is the difference between the user having a paper and
having nothing.

When a build fails, the TeX log is the diagnosis. Read the first line starting
with `!` — it names the problem and the source line — fix the source, and let it
build again. Never hand back a document that does not compile.

On a machine with no LaTeX engine, say so plainly instead of pretending the file
is finished — and point the user at the Overleaf button in the file's header. It
opens a panel that uploads the paper to Overleaf as a new project, or, if their
plan includes Git integration, keeps it in step with an Overleaf project they
already have.

While that panel's tab is open, a linked paper syncs both ways, so a co-author's
edits can land in the `.tex` between your turns. Read the file before changing
it rather than rewriting from what you last wrote, and never hand-resolve a file
the panel reports as changed on both sides — the panel asks the user which copy
to keep, and that is their call.
