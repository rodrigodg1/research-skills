A project is a **tree of experiment nodes**. The root (**baseline**) holds the
starting code and a **run command** — the single shell command that trains or
evaluates the node and prints its results to the run log. Every other node is a
**child** branched off a parent, inheriting its code and its run command. The two
rules this depends on — **never edit a node a run has answered** and
**the run command + env is a fixed contract** — are the cardinal rules;
everything below assumes them.

## Before the first launch

Follow the session playbook's Python policy. Before launching, resolve the
train/evaluation command and compute-specific requirements; ask only if the
project setup leaves these or the chosen workflow unclear. Record the durable
setup and execution recipe in the project's run command.

## Provisional until it answers — repair, don't branch

Every node exists to establish a baseline or test a hypothesis. A run that dies
on an error does **neither** — nothing was established, nothing was tested — so
there is nothing to protect: fix that node's branch in place and re-run the
same node. Successive runs on one node are how you get it working; a new node
is for a new question.

Once a run *does* answer the node — it produced the result the node was after,
good, bad, or `nan` — the node is **frozen**. Its branch is the code that
result came from: never edit it again, branch a child instead. That holds
however the run ended, and it is permanent — a disappointing number is a
result, not a reason to repair.

Unintended behaviour is not an answer. An OOM, a timeout, a divergence from a
bug, a missing dep — those are implementation and hardware details, and the
node is still provisional (unless the node's hypothesis *is* about memory or
runtime, in which case that outcome is exactly its result).

**Repair cap:** two runs in a row that answer nothing on one node, then ask the
user. Different errors still count; a bare relaunch or a flavor/backend switch
is a repair. If the same failure hits a second node, that is one setup problem
— ask then. (Separate from the "~3 failed or regressed runs" scientific stop.)

## Shape the tree — stacked bushes, not a flat fan or a noodle

The single most common way to drive a project badly is to get the **shape** wrong.
There are two opposite failures, and the right shape sits between them:

```
FLAT FAN (wrong)            NOODLE (wrong)            STACKED BUSHES (right)
root                        root                      root
├ a ├ b ├ c ... ├ n         └ a                       └ lr-head        ┐ round 1:
                              └ b                        ├ lr 2e-5     │ a small fan of
                                └ c                      └ lr 3e-5     ┘ co-equal options
                                  └ d ...                   └ winner ── arch-head   ┐ round 2
                                                               ├ arch-A             │ descends onto
                                                               └ arch-B             ┘ round 1's winner
```

- **Flat fan** (your whole sweep hanging off the root): every result is measured
  against the *start*, so wins never accumulate and the tree never makes progress.
- **Noodle** (a long single-child chain): depth manufactured for its own sake —
  each step doesn't actually build on the one above it.
- **Stacked bushes** (correct): a *small fan within a round* (the options of one
  decision), then **descend onto that round's winner** for the next round.

**The one rule that produces this shape.** Before you make X a child of Y, name
what Y established that X builds on:

- **You can name it** ("Y is the LR winner; X keeps that LR and changes the
  architecture") → real depth. X is a **child** of Y. Descend.
- **You can't — X and Y are co-equal options you're trying at the same time**
  (lr 2e-5 vs lr 3e-5) → they don't build on each other. They're **siblings** in
  the same bush. Fan, don't chain.

So: **width = the open options of one decision** (fan freely — a 3-way LR sweep
*should* be three siblings under a common head); **depth = decisions already
resolved, stacked** (one level down per winner kept). A new *round* never hangs off
the root — it hangs off the previous round's winner. That keeps the tree moving
**downward** as research progresses, without stringing unrelated nodes into a line.

Re-read the tree each round — `orx project view <projectId>` lists every node
(id, title, branch; roots marked `[root]`) — and check the shape: a wide row of
direct children off the root with no grandchildren means you're fanning when you
should be descending; a long depth-N chain with no branching means you're chaining
co-equal variants that should have been siblings.

## The auto-research loop

To drive a project toward a goal (e.g. "best convergence for d=8"), this is the
intended flow — do **not** edit a frozen node or rewrite the run command:

1. **Read the baseline's code.** You already sit in a private Git worktree of the
   project's repository. Check out the branch and read it with your normal tools
   (see `orx-git`). See the node's run command with `orx exp status <expId>` and
   find where the knobs live (config files, hyperparameters, model definitions).
2. **Form one round's worth of hypotheses** — the co-equal options of a *single*
   decision (which LR? which schedule? which init?), each a concrete change you can
   make and measure against the others in this round. Don't mix decisions from
   different rounds into one batch — that's what produces the flat fan.
3. **Create the round as a bush, and pick its parent deliberately.** All of this
   round's options are **siblings under one parent** — the title is the idea, the
   description is the concrete change you'll make on that node's branch. The parent is:
   - the **baseline**, only for the very first round (nothing has been won yet); or
   - the **previous round's confirmed winner**, for every round after — so this
     round's changes build *on top of* the last gain instead of resetting to the
     start. This is what walks the tree downward (see "Shape the tree" above).

   ```sh
   # Round 1 — one decision (the LR), its options fanned off the baseline:
   orx create-experiment <projectId> --parent <baseId> --title "LR 2e-5" \
     --description "Set the LR in config.yaml to 2e-5; change nothing else."
   orx create-experiment <projectId> --parent <baseId> --title "LR 3e-5" \
     --description "Set the LR in config.yaml to 3e-5; change nothing else."

   # Round 2 — LR 3e-5 won → the next decision (architecture) descends onto it:
   orx create-experiment <projectId> --parent <lr3e5WinnerId> --title "Wider MLP" \
     --description "On top of the LR-3e-5 winner, widen the MLP hidden dim 1024→2048 in model.py."
   ```
   The child inherits its parent's run command automatically — you don't set it,
   and you never give siblings different commands or env vars (cardinal rule 2).
4. **Implement each child's change on its Git branch** — `orx create-experiment`
   prints the child's branch (`orx/<slug>`); in your worktree:
   ```sh
   git checkout orx/<child-slug>
   #   …edit only the files that idea touches…
   git commit -am "cosine LR + warmup"
   ```
   **Leave the run command alone.** Before launching, load `orx-evidence` and
   make sure the committed code emits enough run evidence to judge the node.
5. **Launch the round's ready children**: `orx exp run <childId> --backend <b>`
   (or omit `--backend` when a default target is set — see `orx-compute`). Remote
   backends can run siblings in parallel; `--backend local` shares this machine's
   CPU, RAM, and GPU.
6. **Keep the round moving — drive a per-completion loop, not a wait-for-all
   barrier.** You want control back the moment *any one* run finishes so you can
   analyze it and either refill its slot or stop — not after the whole batch
   drains. `orx exp wait --project <projectId>` is built for exactly this: it
   returns on the **first** completion. Treat it as one **tick** of a loop, where
   *you* are the loop body:

   ```
   # after launching your runs, loop until the project is drained:
   loop:
     orx exp wait --project <projectId>   # sleeps; returns on the first completion
     orx runs <projectId>                 # SOURCE OF TRUTH: re-read all run states
     # for each run now terminal that you haven't handled yet:
     #   - read its results (step 7) and decide: launch a refill? promote it? stop?
     #   - launch the next queued child to refill the freed slot (step 5)
     # if `exp wait` printed "drained: no runs in flight"  → batch is done, break
   ```

   Three things make this robust — follow all of them:
   - **`exp wait --project` is a sleep-until-change signal, not the source of
     truth.** It only reports completions it observed *during that one call*. A
     run that finishes while you're analyzing the previous one is already terminal
     by the next call and **won't be reported**. So on every wake, re-read
     `orx runs <projectId>` and reconcile against the set of runs you've already
     handled — act on *every* newly-terminal run, not just the line `exp wait`
     printed. (This is the one time you do look at `orx runs` in a loop — as the
     reconcile after each wake, **not** as a tight poll in place of `exp wait`.)
   - **Re-issue `exp wait` each tick.** One completion → one return → you decide →
     you call it again. Don't expect a single `exp wait` to block until everything
     is done; that's the failure mode this loop avoids.
   - **Terminate on drained.** When no runs are in flight, `exp wait --project`
     returns immediately printing `drained: no runs in flight`. That — or seeing
     every run terminal in `orx runs` with no more children to launch — is your
     exit condition. Don't keep calling it into a timeout.
7. **Analyze each finish as it lands, then iterate.** Do the per-completion read
   *inside the loop above*, not deferred to the end — when a run finishes,
   **actually read its results** with `orx logs <runId>` (see `orx-evidence`). To
   see exactly what a finished node changed, diff its branch against its parent's
   branch (see `orx-git`). Don't infer from status alone. Each
   completion is a decision point with four moves:
   - **Repair** — the run answered nothing: fix this node's branch and
     re-launch the same node (above).
   - **Refill** — result is mediocre or inconclusive: launch the next queued child to
     keep the round moving (step 5).
   - **Promote** — result is a clear win: this node becomes the **parent for the next
     round**. The next batch of children branch off *it*, not the baseline, so the win
     carries forward and the next ideas stack on top of it. This is the move that makes
     the tree grow deeper; skipping it is what produces a flat, sweep-only tree.
   - **Stop** — goal met, or the branch is exhausted.

   Frozen nodes stay untouched throughout — promotion moves the *focal parent*
   down the tree, it never rewrites a node that already measured something.

Stop when the goal is met, or after ~3 consecutive failed or regressed runs.
When you stop, write up the tree as a descriptively named project artifact — see
the `orx-reports` skill for naming and folder guidance.

Close any turn that ran or changed experiments with a short experiment summary:
one line per relevant node with what it tested, its status, and the headline
result. Follow the session playbook's evidence-and-links contract. Plain
questions and turns that launch or change no experiments need no summary.

## Experiment description / notes — `orx exp desc`

Each experiment node carries a free-form **description** (markdown) — the same
field set by `create-experiment --description`. Use it for notes: observations,
hypotheses, or a running summary. It is a whole-document field: writing
overwrites whatever was there.

```sh
orx exp desc <expId>                          # print the description to stdout (empty → hint on stderr)
orx exp desc <expId> --set "tried lr=3e-4, diverged at step 4k"   # overwrite with a short note
cat notes.md | orx exp desc <expId> --stdin   # overwrite from stdin (long markdown)
```

- **Read** prints the text to **stdout** (pipe/redirect-friendly); when empty, a
  hint is printed to **stderr** and stdout stays empty.
- **Write** with exactly one of `--set` (inline) or `--stdin` (whole of stdin).
  Passing both is an error. Writing **replaces** the entire description — to
  append, read first, edit, and write back.
- `<expId>` comes from `orx create-experiment` output or `orx project view
  <projectId>` (the experiment id, not a run or project id).
